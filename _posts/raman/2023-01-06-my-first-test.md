In 1928, Sir Chandrasekhra Venkata Raman discoverd the phenomenon.    
Raman spectroscopy is that when monochromatic light is exposed to a gas or a transparent liquid solid, slightly different wavelengths are emitted in the diffuser tube.
At this momment, the scattering means when light passes through a medium, it changes the wavelength of light so that some of the light travels. If it changes wavelength, this phenomenon called '**_Raman Scattering_**' or '**_Raman effect_**'.
