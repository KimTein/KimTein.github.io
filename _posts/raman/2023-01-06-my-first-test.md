# About Raman Spectroscopy

First of all, I study using the followin books.

## Sir Raman

In 1928, Sir Chandrasekhra Venkata Raman discoverd the phenomenon. He detected when blue light passes through the solution, green light is scattered. Nowadays, with the development of spectrometers, we can measure the intensity of light as bands or repetitive bands according to frequency on spectrum.    
Raman spectroscopy is that when monochromatic light is exposed to a gas or a transparent liquid solid, slightly different wavelengths are emitted in the diffuser tube. At this momment, the scattering means when light passes through a medium, it changes the wavelength of light so that some of the light travels. If it changes wavelength, this phenomenon called '**_Raman Scattering_**' or '**_Raman effect_**'.   

## Raman Scattering
{: .text-center}

When light passes through a medium, some of the light is scattered and deviates from the direction of propagation. At this time, the scattered light has the original energy as it is, but it is less than the energy of the original light. The process of the scattered light maintaining the original energy is called **_Rayleigh scattering_** or **_Elastic scattering_**. Contrary the process of scattering while losing or gaining energy is called **_Raman scattering_** or **_Inelastic scattering_**.
